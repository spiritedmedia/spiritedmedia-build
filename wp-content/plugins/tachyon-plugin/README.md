Tachyon is an image resizing processor built to be used with Amazon S3 as the image backend, and sits
behind a CDN such as CloudFlare.

It's forked from [Photon](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/photon/) however uses Image Magick rather than Graphics Magic.

## Credits
Created by Human Made for high volume and large-scale sites, such as [Happytables](http://happytables.com/). We run Tachyon on sites with millions of monthly page views, and thousands of sites.

Written and maintained by [Joe Hoyle](https://github.com/joehoyle).

Tachyon is forked from Photon by Automattic Inc. As Tachyon is not an all-purpose image resizer, rather it uses a media library in Amazon S3, it has a different use case to Photon.
