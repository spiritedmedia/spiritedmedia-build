A fine selection of Shortcake-powered shortcodes.

== Description ==

Shortcake Bakery adds a fine selection of shortcodes to your WordPress site. Use with [Shortcake](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/) for the optimal experience.

The following shortcodes are now available for your use within the content field:

- ABC_News `[abc-news]`
- Facebook `[facebook]`
- Flickr `[flickr]`
- Giphy `[giphy]`
- GoogleDocs `[googledocs]` (Includes several common formats: Documents, Spreadsheets, Presentations, Forms, Maps, and Fusion Tables.)
- Guardian `[guardian]`
- Image Comparison `[image-comparison]` (Uses the juxtapose.js script from Knight Labs.)
- Infogram `[infogram]`
- Instagram `[instagram]`
- Live Photo `[live-photo]`
- Livestream `[livestream]`
- PDF Viewer `[pdf]` (PDF documents can be uploaded attachments or remotely hosted documents. A code-based proxy pass can be made available for external documents with a filter.)
- Playbuzz `[playbuzz]`
- Rap_Genius `[rap-genius]`
- Scribd `[scribd]`
- Script `[script]` (Requires code-level configuration of accepted domains.)
- Silk `[silk]`
- SoundCloud `[soundcloud]`
- Twitter `[twitter]`
- Videoo `[videoo]`
- Vimeo `[vimeo]`
- Vine `[vine]`
- YouTube `[youtube]`
- iFrame `[iframe]` (Requires code-level configuration of accepted domains.)

Shortcake Bakery also enables an "Add Embed Code" experience for Shortcake shortcodes. Clicking the "Add Embed Code" media button will display a form in the media modal where a user can paste an embed code as received from a provider (by copying the embed code from a YouTube video, for one example). If that embed code matches a shortcode registered with the Shortcake Bakery shortcode API, the matched shortcode will be sent to the editor.

See the [Installation](#Installation) section for code-level configuration details. Get involved with the project and [submit your own shortcodes](https://github.com/fusioneng/shortcake-bakery) on Github.

== Installation ==

It's a plugin! Install it like any other.

Most of the shortcodes work out of the box, but you'll need to whitelist any domains you want to be eligible for script and iFrame tag use.

`
add_filter( 'shortcake_bakery_whitelisted_script_domains', function(){
	return array(
		'ajax.googleapis.com',
	);
});
`

`
add_filter( 'shortcake_bakery_whitelisted_iframe_domains', function(){
	return array(
		'buzzfeed.com',
	);
});
`

If you don't want to enable all of the shortcodes which are bundled with this plugin, you can filter them by returning a smaller array from the filter 'shortcake_bakery_shortcode_classes':

`
add_filter( 'shortcake_bakery_shortcode_classes', function() {
	return array(
		'Shortcake_Bakery\Shortcodes\Facebook',
		'Shortcake_Bakery\Shortcodes\Twitter',
		'Shortcake_Bakery\Shortcodes\YouTube',
	);
});
`

Because of cross-domain issues, the `[pdf]` shortcode will only work out of the box with PDFs uploaded as local attachments, or that are served with appropriate Cross-Origin Resource Sharing headers. (If you don't know about the domain you're hosting the PDFs on, most likely it doesn't include these headers and as a result, the PDF will not render properly on the front end.)

If you need to be able to serve pdf documents from other domains, you will need to set up an asset proxy for them. We have a basic PHP-based asset proxy built in to the plugin, which is disabled by default. If you want to enable it, return true from the following filter:

`
add_filter( 'shortcake_bakery_pdf_enable_cors_proxy', '__return_true' );
`

This feature should be enabled only with conscious thought, though, as if this is used heavily, it has the potential to cause serious performance issues. If you will be serving many, or very large PDFs, we recommend building your own proxy for these - using an nginx [proxy_pass](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass) directive, for example.

== Screenshots ==

1. Shortcodes are accessible through the Insert Element screen, exposed in the media library.
2. Shortcodes preview in the visual editor, with a quick edit button to provide easy access to attribute fields.
3. The image comparison shortcode is powered by JuxtaposeJS, a tool built by the Northwestern University Knight Lab.
4. We've added an Infogram shortcode that accepts public Infogram URL's.
5. Scribd shortcodes let you embed documents easily in your WordPress content.
6. The script shortcode lets you embed whitelisted sources.
7. Same with the iFrame shortcode.
8. The RapGenius shortcode doesn't do anything in the admin â€“ but on the frontend, it adds annotations to your post.
9. The PDF shortcode wraps your document in a nifty viewer tool.
10. Most Facebook URL's can be embedded with ease.
11. Playbuzz quizs can be embedded, with a few options supported.
12. An "Add Embed" button is added to the editor media buttons.
12. Clicking the "Add Embed" button brings up a from to insert a provided embed code. If an embed code doesn't match a known shortcode, a warning will be displayed. (Note - other plugins such as WordPress VIP's Protected Embeds functionality that reverse arbitrary embed codes to shortcodes in other ways can also hook in to this and make their own replacements.)
13. If an embed code can be recognized as matching one of the Shortcake Bakery shortcodes, or any shortcodes which make use of this plugin's API, it can be inserted from this screen...
14. ... and it will be sent to the editor as the corresponding shortcode, rather than the full embed code.

== Changelog ==

This release includes 14 new shortcodes, and some major new features for users.
