<h1>User Card aka Contributor Highlight</h1>

## User Grid Shortcode

This shortcode is used on each site's About page.

```
{{ user_grid_shortcode }}
```

<div class="clearfix">
{{ user_grid_shortcode|shortcodes }}
</div>

## Compact Format

Currently this is only in use on Billy Penn on articles written by Featured
Contributors. [Here is an
example](https://billypenn.com/2016/07/25/sister-mary-scullion-let-dnc-visitors-see-philadelphias-dark-side/).
This initiative has since been abandoned, so this is only here for historial
reasons. If we do add a contributor highlight for the author of each article it
will likely use this component.

<div class="clearfix">
{% include "partials/user-card.twig" with { format: 'compact' } %}
</div>

## Extended Format

This is used on author profile pages. Note that in this example the pagination
will not work â€“ you'll have to go to a live author page to test that.

<div class="clearfix">
{% include "partials/user-card.twig" with { format: 'extended' } %}
</div>

{% endmarkdown %}

</div>

{% endblock %}
