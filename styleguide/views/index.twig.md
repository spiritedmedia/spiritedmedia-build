# Spirited Media's Styleguide

**Note that our styles here don't affect the WordPress admin area or any other
part of the site requiring a logged in user.** Components used in the WordPress
admin area won't be covered in this styleguide, meaning that the live usage of
components in the admin area also won't be covered.

Also note that this styleguide can not be 100% accurate. Any omissions or other
mistakes should be reported to the product team and a ticket should be opened to
address the issue.

## Core Components

- [Buttons](buttons.php) / [Buttons V2](buttons-v2.php)
- [Forms](forms.php) / [Forms V2](forms-v2.php)
- [Headers](headers.php)
